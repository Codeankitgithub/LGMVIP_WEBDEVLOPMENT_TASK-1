        <p class="sectionSubTag text small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values,
             morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and
              directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. 
              Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels,
               or acts may be considered educational.The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.Formal education is commonly divided formally
                into stages such as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.
                In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">History of Education in india</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills
             deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling 
             passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills
             that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle 
             Kingdom.[2]


            Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
            Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[3] The city of Alexandria 
            in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of Ancient Greece. There, 
            the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy 
            and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.[4]
            
            In China, Confucius (551-479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's most influential ancient philosopher,
             whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.
              Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance,
               but his Analects were written down by followers and have continued to influence education in East Asia into the modern era.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Transforming Education in India</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text small">The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major
             “silent hindrance” for India's track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues,
             it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve
              issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a 
              developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of 
              Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren't actually visible….

              We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a
              21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…
            
              For this, the first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting stuff from the syllabus, 
              which almost 90% is irrelevant and students actually forget sooner or later and should be replaced with a practical and 
              solution-centric approach to studies which will develop thinkers and leaders of tomorrow.</p>
